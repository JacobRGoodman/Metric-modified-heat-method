# Metric-modified-heat-method
The code runs the heat method of Crane et. al. to approximate Riemannian distances on a triangulated mesh. We apply the method with a modified Riemannian metric chosen so that distances inflate near a prescribed obstacle. Geodesics of this metric avoid the obstacle, and are constructed by applying gradient descent to the Riemannian distance.
